Create Database in mysql 
> create database Database_Name;


Create table
> create table person(id int,name varchar(50),dob date);


Create table with constraints
> create table person(
id int not null unique auto_increment,
name varchar(50) not null,
age int not null check(age>18),
dob date not null 
);


Add data in table
> insert into person (id, name, dob) value(1, "Zee", "1994-09-08");


Adding multiple values in single table in one query
> insert into person (id, name, dob) 
value
(3, "Ali", "1998-10-28"),
(4, "Huma", "1966-10-28"),
(5, "Faisal", "1896-10-28");


Select all data from table

Check null and not null
> select * from person where age is null;
> select * from person where age is not null;


Add Limit to record
> select * from person limit 2;(it will only show 2 records)
Note: We can also put condition in this query. and then this query will apply condition on table and will only show limited number of records


Add offset to record
> select * from person limit 3, 2; (here 3 is the offset and 2 is the limit)
Note: Offset will skip first 3 rows and will show data from 4th column up to given limit.
